# Vanilla Javascript Webpack Production Template

From the tutorial at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-production-ready-webpack-4-config-from-scratch/

### Notes from Tutorial

#### Let's review what we've learned so far:

* Webpack is a build tool for asset bundling and dependency management.

* Webpack can be configured by a config file.

* Plugins modify and extend the webpack build process.

* Loaders instruct webpack how to handle different file types.

* The clean-webpack-plugin can be used to remove old build artifacts from the dist directory.

* The html-webpack-plugin helps manage the HTML file, including injecting JavaScript into the file via script tags.

* webpack-dev-server creates a dev server to make local development easier.

* It's helpful to have separate webpack configs for development and production. You can share and merge config files using the webpack-merge plugin.

* We can handle styling our app by including loaders like css-loader, style-loader, sass-loader, less-loader, and the mini-css-extract-plugin (which functions as both a plugin and a loader).

* We can include new JavaScript syntax and features by using Babel and babel-loader.

* We can include content hashes in our file names to help with cache busting and managing new versions of our released code.

* We can minify our CSS with the optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin.

* We can minify our JavaScript with the terser-webpack-plugin.
